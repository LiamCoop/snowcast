SnowCast allows users to open a portal into current weather conditions and forecasted conditions for their favourite Ski Areas.
Ski Area location data has been provided courtesy of SkiMap.org, while the weather data is fetched from OpenWeatherMap.
The mapping has been accomplished using React-Map-GL npm package (https://github.com/visgl/react-map-gl), a React friendly API wrapper around MapboxGL JS.
