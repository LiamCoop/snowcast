SnowCast allows users to open a porthole into current weather conditions and forecasted conditions for their favourite SkiAreas.
Ski Area location data has been provided courtesy of SkiMap.org, while the weather data is fetched from OpenWeatherMap.
The mapping has been accomplished using Mapbox's React-Map-GL npm package.
