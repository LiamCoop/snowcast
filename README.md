Small website showcasing front-end skills using Javascript, Typescript, React, nodeJS, HTML, and CSS.

SnowCast allows users to open a portal into current weather conditions and forecasted conditions for their favourite Ski Areas.
Ski Area location data has been provided courtesy of SkiMap.org, while the weather data is fetched from OpenWeatherMap.
The mapping has been accomplished using React-Map-GL npm package (https://github.com/visgl/react-map-gl), a React friendly API wrapper around MapboxGL JS.


Reflections:

If I were to do this again I probably would've used styled-components. It would've minimized a lot of the confusion I had surrounding some of the CSS issues I wound up troubleshooting.
I think I probably should've minimized the amount of things that I tried to learn over the course of this project as I may have bit off more than I could chew in trying to learn Typescript and React while still just being new to CSS/HTML.
